## Setting the Local Time

We can set the local time very easily with the command:

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
```

To look through the available time zones if you are not in the same time zone as me, you can look through the countries available with:

```bash
ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/
```

After finding your country or one that shares a time zone with you, you can find the specific one with:

```bash
ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/<your-country>
```

Then, you can set your local time the same as above with your country and city.

## Setting up Network Time Protocol (NTP) Servers

We will need to edit the `systemd` configuration file for this with:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
```

You should see a section labelled `[Time]`. You will want to replace the two `NTP` and `FallbackNTP` lines with:

```bash
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org
```

After saving and closing the file, we can then enable the service at system start with:

```bash
systemctl enable systemd-timesyncd.service
```
