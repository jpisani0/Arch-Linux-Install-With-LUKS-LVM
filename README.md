# Arch Linux Install Guide

This is my in-depth guide to how I install Arch Linux. This is a refresher for myself should I ever need it, though I hope that it may help anyone else looking to install the OS. This was written in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault and is the recommended way to view it, though it can also be viewed on this GitHub. To view the guide through Obsidian, clone this repo and then open it with the software.

**Be sure to cross reference this guide with the [Arch Linux Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) in case any of this information becomes out-of-date and I have not yet updated it**
