I prefer KDE as my desktop environment, but I don't like getting the `meta` packages for it since it comes with a lot of packages I don't want or need, so I install these following packages:

```bash
pacman -S plasma konsole dolphin ark doplhin-plugins discover okular gwenview sddm sddm-kcm breeze plasma-nm
```

This install the KDE plasma desktop environment and common needed software such as a terminal emulator, file browser, PDF viewer, login manager, etc.  After installing these packages, I also like to customize the login screen with the `breeze` theme. We can do this by, first, generating a configuration file for `sddm` with:

```bash
sddm --example-config > /etc/sddm.conf
```

Then we can open the `/etc/sddm.conf` file and look for the `[Theme]` line and insert this below it:

```bash
current=breeze
```

Then we just need to enable the login manager on startup with:

```bash
systemctl enable sddm
```
