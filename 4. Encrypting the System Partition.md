We keep the boot and EFI partitions unencrypted as they don't hold any sensitive information and make it easier to boot into the OS. Our encrypted partition(s), however, will be holding sensitive information as they will be holding our swap file, root, and home volumes.

## Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)

LUKS is a disk encryption specification created by Clemens Fruhwirth that comes standard with the Linux kernel. It is a tried and true encryption system that is easily integrated into our OS, so we will be using it to secure all sensitive information in our system.

## Encrypting the Partitions

First, we first need to ensure the encryption modules are loaded using:

```bash
modprobe dm-crypt
modprove dm-mod
```

To encrypt our partition(s), find them using `lsblk` and use:

```bash
cryptsetup luksFormat -v -s 512 -h sha512 /dev/<your-device>
```

- -v: verbose output for the command
- -s: size of the key, in bits
- -h: the hashing algorithm for LUKS key setup

This is a particular setup I like, since it gives good security to the partitions but also doesn't take too long to decrypt on boot. **Note that if you are using a HDD or particularly slow SSD, you may see longer decryption times on boot**

After entering the command, you will be prompted to confirm to continue as the process deletes all data in the partition, and then to enter a password for the partition. Of course, make sure this is a password you will remember or save it in a secure spot, as forgetting it will mean all data on your computer will be irrecoverable.

We can then open our newly encrypted partition to be accessible using:

```bash
cryptsetup open /dev/<your-encrypted-device> luks_lvm0
```

You will be prompted for the password you just set to decrypt and open the device. You should then be able to see the unencrypted device with `lsblk` as a branch under the encrypted device. Adding `luks_lvm0` sets the name for the device, and should be accessible via `/dev/mapper/luks_lvm0`, though feel free to name it whatever you like.

For now, we will only be encrypting the third partition on the first drive. If you have any other drives, we will be encrypting them later since the process will be done slightly differently.
