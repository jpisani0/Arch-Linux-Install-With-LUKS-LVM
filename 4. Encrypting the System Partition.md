We keep the EFI partition unencrypted as it doesn't hold any sensitive information and makes it easier to boot into the OS. Our encrypted partition(s), however, will be holding sensitive information as they will be holding our swap file, root, and home volumes.

## Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)

LUKS is a disk encryption specification created by Clemens Fruhwirth that comes standard with the Linux kernel. It is a tried and true encryption system that is easily integrated into our OS, so we will be using it to secure all sensitive information in our system.

## Encrypting the Partitions

First, we first need to ensure the encryption modules are loaded using:

```bash
modprobe dm-crypt
modprobe dm-mod
```

To encrypt our partition(s), find them using `lsblk` and use:

```bash
cryptsetup luksFormat -v -s 512 -h sha512 /dev/<your-device-partition>
```

- -v: verbose output for the command
- -s: size of the key, in bits
- -h: the hashing algorithm for LUKS key setup

This is a particular setup I like, since it gives a good balance of security and speed. **Note that if you are using a HDD or particularly slow SSD, you may see longer decryption times on boot.**

After entering the command, you will be prompted to confirm to continue as the process deletes all data in the partition, and then to enter a password for the partition. **Make sure you save this password somewhere safe, preferably a password manager, as you will not be able to recover your data from the encrypted device if you forget it.**

We can then open our newly encrypted partition to be accessible using:

```bash
cryptsetup open /dev/<your-encrypted-device> luks_lvm0
```

You will be prompted for the password you just set to decrypt and open the device. You should then be able to see the unencrypted device with `lsblk` as a branch under the encrypted device. Adding `luks_lvm0` sets the name for the device, and should be accessible via `/dev/mapper/luks_lvm0`, though feel free to name it whatever you like.

Repeat these steps for all additional drives in your system. I also recommend using the same password for each device. If you use different passwords, you will need to enter each one at boot every time. If they are all the same, then entering the password once will unlock all of your encrypted devices. Just make sure the password is secure.
