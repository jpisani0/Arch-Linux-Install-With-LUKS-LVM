If your machine has a bluetooth device, we can install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pacman -S bluez bluez-utils
```

We can then enable it at boot with:

```bash
systemctl enable bluetooth.service
```

If you are planning the install the KDE Plasma desktop environment like myself on the next page, then you should also install the `bluedevil` package so that you can edit your bluetooth connections through the desktop.
