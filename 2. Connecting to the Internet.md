## Connecting via Ethernet

If you are on a machine with an Ethernet port, you should be connected to the internet just from plugging a cable in. You can check using:

```bash
ip link
```

If you are connected, you should see an output similar to this:

```bash
2: enp12s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000  
   link/ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx brd xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx  
   altname enxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Another check and the way I prefer to check is by pinging a website of your choice, I usually do `ping archlinux.org`. If you are receiving packets, you are connected to the internet.

If you are not connected to the internet and you confirmed that its not an issue with your network or cable, then you are likely on some hardware that requires special firmware, such as a Microsoft Surface Laptop. Try looking up fixes for your specific hardware if this is the case.

## Connecting via WiFi

If your machine does not have an Ethernet port, we will need to connect via WiFi. We can use the `iwctl` command to enter its interactive shell. We first need to find the name of our WiFi device using:

```bash
station list
```

You should see something like `wlan0`, but if yours has a different name, replace it for all uses of `wlan0` for the rest of this guide. After finding the name of your wireless device, we can find the available access points using:

```bash
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
```

After finding your network, you can connect to it using:

```bash
station wlan0 connect <Your-WiFi-SSID>
```

It will then prompt you for the password. If you don't get an error back, you should be connected and can exit the `iwctl` shell. We can then verify we are connected to the internet using either `ip link` or `ping archlinux.org` the same way as the previous section.
