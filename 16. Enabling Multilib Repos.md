You will most likely want to enable `multilib` repos for `pacman` to get access to 32 bit software. There is software such as `steam` that is from the `multilib` repos, as well as graphics card support, and any other software or libraries that would require 32 bit support. 

To enable `multilib`, we will first need to open the `pacman` configuration file with:

```bash
nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

Then, you will need to find the line `[multilib]` and uncomment both that line and the line below it. We can then update `pacman` with the `multilib` repos with:

```bash
pacman -Syu
```
