## Securing the Root User

We will first want to secure the root user with a password so that it is still accessible should be we need to log into it. We can do this by entering the `passwd` command and entering the password we want for it twice. It is recommended to use a password separate from your user's password, that we will be setting up next, and that you make sure it is something you can't forgot or is stored safely somewhere if you do.


## (OPTIONAL) Installing the Shell

If you wish to use a shell other than `bash` by default, you should install it now before we create the user. For example, if you prefer `zsh`, install it with:

```bash
pacman -S zsh
```

## Creating Our User

We can create our user with this command:

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel,power,storage -s /bin/bash <your-username>
```

- -m: Indicates that a home directory should be created for this user
- -G: Adds the user to the groups listed after this
	- `wheel`: Group to allow the user to access administrator privileges with `sudo`
	- `power`: Gives user control over power (`shutdown`, `reboot`, etc.)
	- `storage`: Gives user access to the storage on the machine
- -s: Specifies the default shell for the user. If you wanted something other than `bash`, replace it with that other shell, like `-s /bin/zsh`

Now that we have created our user, we can set the password for it with:

```bash
passwd <your-username>
```

## Giving the User SUDO Privileges

Although we have already added our user to the `wheel` group, we need to edit to `sudo` configuration file to actually allow user in the `wheel` group to access administrator privileges. We first want to make sure the default editor is our preferred one, so we will do:

```bash
export EDITOR=nano
```

Replace `nano` with your text editor if it's different.  We can then open the configuration file with `visudo`. You will then need to find this line:

```bash
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

It will be commented with a `#`, which you will need to remove.
