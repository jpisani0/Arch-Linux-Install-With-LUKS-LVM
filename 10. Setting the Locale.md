Setting up the locale is another relatively easy process. We will first need to open the generation file:

```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen
```

You will need to look for your locale's code. Mine is `en_US.UTF-8`. Scroll down to it and uncomment that line by removing the `#` preceding it. Then we can save and close the file and generate the locale with:

```bash
locale-gen
```

Lastly, we need to add this locale to the configuration file with:

```bash
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```

Use your locale if it is different from mine.
