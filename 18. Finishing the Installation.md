We are now ready to restart the system and boot into it. We will first exit the `arch-chroot` shell with the `exit` command. Then we can unmount all of our partitions with:

```bash
umount -R /mnt
```

Then we can reboot the system with `reboot`. While the machine is rebooting, be sure to remove the USB drive. You should then be booted into `grub`, choose the kernel to boot into (most likely the default option), and be able to log into your desktop. Congrats! Please let me know if there is anything in this guide that is not clear enough, not explained enough, incorrect, or outdated. Thank you!
