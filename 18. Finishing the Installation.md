We are now ready to restart the system and boot into it. We will first exit the `arch-chroot` shell with the `exit` command. Then we can unmount all of our partitions with:

```bash
umount -R /mnt
```

Then we can power down the system with `shutdown now`. After it shuts down completely, we can remove the USB drive, start up the PC, and again enter the BIOS to set our first boot option as GRUB now. 

You should boot into the GRUB menu and choose the first boot option. The `initramfs` will then be loaded and you will be prompted for a password for your devices. If you made them all the same, you will only get prompted for one device. You should then be greeted with your desktop log in page and be able to log into the desktop. Congrats!
