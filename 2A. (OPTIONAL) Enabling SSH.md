This step is entirely optional, but enabling SSH on your Arch Linux ISO may be more useful than you may think. I almost always do this for 2 main reasons.

The first is that, by enabling SSH, I can log in from another computer with a terminal emulator. A terminal emulator is more user-friendly than the raw terminal available in the ISO as it support copying and pasting and scrolling through the output, as well as many other advantages.

The second is that by logging in from another computer, I am able to easily check with the Arch Wiki from this other computer instead of having to flip back and forth between 2 devices. It's always a good idea to consult the Wiki during the installation process, even when following this guide or if you get familiar enough to do it from memory, as things are always changing and it's good practice to make sure you are always up to date.

To enable SSH, we will first set a password for the root user of the ISO using the `passwd` command. I usually give it something easy like 'temp', as this password does not get carried over between boots of the ISO or to your installation.

Next, we can enable the SSH service using:

```bash
systemctl start sshd
```

Lastly, we need to grab the IP address of this device using:

```bash
ip addr
```

After grabbing the IP address, we can now go to our other machine and connect using:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.XXX
```

It will ask you to trust this computer and then enter the password before logging you into the ISO.
