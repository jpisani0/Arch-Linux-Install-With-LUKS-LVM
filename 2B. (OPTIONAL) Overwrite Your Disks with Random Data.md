This step is also entirely optional, but I do heavily recommend doing this step, especially since we plan to encrypt our drives. The reason we want to fill it will random data is that it hides the boundaries of our encrypted partitions. Encrypted data looks like random data, so without it, someone looking at the drive can clearly see the boundaries for the encrypted data. If we overwrite the whole drive with random data, though, the presumed attacker will not be able to tell where the encrypted data ends and random noise starts.

We can list out the devices on our machine using `lsblk`. You should see `/dev/sda`, which is most likely the USB drive we are currently booted into, as well as any other drives on the machine. Find the drive(s) that you plan to install Arch on. Once you have them, we can overwrite them with random data using:

```bash
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/<your-device> bs=4096 status=progress
```

This will take a variable amount of time, largely depending on the size of your drives but also on your drive write speeds, CPU speed, and memory. If you have a particularly large amount of storage, consider letting this run unattended and having one start right after the other with `&&` for multiple devices.
