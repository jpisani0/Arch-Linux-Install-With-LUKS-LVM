## Why use an LVM?

Using a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) rather than normal partitions gives us several advantages. In the event we have multiple physical drives, an LVM can present these to the OS as 1 drive, meaning we can extend something like the home partition with a second drive without Linux seeing it as a separate drive and having us mount it to a directory. 

But LVMs are still very useful even when using only one drive. Resizing standard partitions can be a pain. You may need to extend the swap file in the event you upgrade your available memory or need to extend the root partition, which is a cumbersome process, usually requiring you to back up partition data to another device, reformatting the partitions in your current one (thus deleting all data in them), and then loading the backup back into your newly formatted partitions. LVMs do away with this, as they make it extremely easy to add and remove space from different volumes in a volume group.

## Creating the Volume Group

We first need to create a volume group. To initialize each of our decrypted devices for use in a volume group, we can enter:

```bash
pvcreate /dev/mapper/<your-decrypted-device>
```

Use this command on all devices if you have more than 1. Then, to create the volume group, we can use:

```bash
vgcreate arch /dev/mapper/<your-decrypted-device1> /dev/mapper/<your-decrypted-device2> ...
```

`arch` is the name I choose for the volume group, which can of course be changed to anything you want.

## Creating the Volumes

Now that the volume group is created, we can start adding volumes to it.

First is the root volume. The minimum recommended size for the root volume is 40 GB, though I would personally recommend 50 GB for standard users and extending that further for developers, as you will find that root will fill up very quickly with the IDEs, runtimes, compilers, libraries, virtual machines, etc. you end up installing on them. I usually do 100 GB as I have a lot of space and it is usually enough to work with, though it is an easy process to extend later if needed.

```bash
lvcreate -n root -L 100G arch
```

It is recommended that the swap file is your available memory plus 2 additional GB as a buffer. My machine has 32 GB of memory, so I will be making it 34 GB in size. To do this, we can use:

```bash
lvcreate -n swap -L 34G -C y arch
```

- -n: the name of the volume
- -L: the size of the volume
- -C: set this volume as contiguous, which is ideal for the swap file. The `y` is to confirm this.

Lastly, we have the home volume, which will be using all remaining data in the volume group. To do that, we will enter:

```bash
lvcreate -n home -l 100%FREE arch
```

Now that we have created all of our volumes, we should be able to view them using `lsblk` to ensure all looks good.
