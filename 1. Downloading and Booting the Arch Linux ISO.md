## Downloading and verifying the installation image

Download the latest arch linux image (archlinux-XXXX.XX.XX-x86_64.iso) from https://archlinux.org/download/ as well as the 2 checksum files (b2sums.txt and sha256sums.txt) and signature file (archlinux-XXX.XX.XX-x86_64.iso.sig). Download your platform's ISO if its not x86_64.

We can check that the ISO file was not corrupted by checking the 2 checksum files we downloaded, b2sums.txt and sha256sums.txt, like so:

```bash
b2sum -c b2sums.txt --ignore-missing
```

```bash
sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt --ignore-missing
```


We can verify the authenticity of this image by checking the signature. You'll need [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html) installed for this. Once you have it installed, we can download the public key to verify the signature by using:

```bash
gpg --auto-key-locate clear,wkd -v --locate-external-key pierre@archlinux.org
```

We should also verify the fingerprint of this key with:

```bash
gpg --fingerprint pierre@archlinux.org
```

Check the output of this command with the 'PGP Signature' line on the download page. It should include the last 8 hexadecimal digits of the output of the fingerprint command. We can then verify the signature using this command:

```bash
gpg --verify archlinux-XXXX.XX.XX-x86_64.iso.sig
```


## Flashing the ISO File onto a USB Drive

Now that we have verified the installation image, we can flash it onto a USB drive in a bootable format. There are a couple of ways to do this, such as using the `dd` command or Ventoy, but the easiest way to do this from all platforms is to download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/), a free and open source flashing software. Simply download Etcher, select the ISO file and your USB drive, hit flash, and you will have a bootable USB in a few minutes. **Note that this will wipe everything on your USB drive.**


## Booting into the Arch Linux ISO

Turn off the computer you will be installing Arch onto completely. Then you can insert the USB drive and turn on the computer. We will be entering the UEFI/BIOS of the machine. This can usually be done by spamming one of your F keys while the computer is turning on. If your motherboard does not display the input for entering the bios on startup, you should be able to find how to enter it from a quick Google search of your motherboard or computer if it is a proprietary machine like a Dell or HP laptop.

Once you enter the UEFI/BIOS, we will need to find 2 important settings: secure boot and boot order. Secure boot will most likely be enabled by default and prevent us from booting into the USB, so you will need to disable that. Then, for the boot order, make sure your USB drive is the first boot option on your machine. 

You can then save and exit from the UEFI/BIOS, and your machine should reboot into the Arch Linux ISO. You will be prompted with a couple of boot options and can choose to boot into the default.
